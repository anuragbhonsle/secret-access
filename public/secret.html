        📜 Anurag's Secrets 📜
      </h1>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-800 text-lg">
        <li>I’m learning Japanese. It’s my 4th language.</li>
        <li>I’m grinding DSA in C++. I like to solve problems.</li>
        <li>
          I’m 6'1", naturally skinny, but I’m bulking like a lean Spider-Man —
          dips, pull-ups, and dreams.
        </li>
        <li>
          I once said “Trying to be the man I’d want my daughter to marry and my
          son to look up to.”
        </li>
        <li>
          I journal because I want my grandson to say: “Grandpa used to fight
          Genichiro Ashina in Sekiro.”
        </li>
        <li>
          I drink milk coffee like it’s my XP potion. Full glass. Always. ☕🥛
        </li>
        <li>
          I know Jesus lived twice — and so will I. I’m a born again Christian.
          ✝️
        </li>
        <li>
          I like Domestic Girlfriend unironically. Not proud. But I am real.
          🧼🗑️
        </li>
        <li>
          I named my hypothetical dog “Genichiro.” That man chopped my arm —
          respect.
        </li>
        <li>I flexed that I can touch the fan. No chair. Just genes.</li>
        <li>
          I once said “I’d like a giraffe if it wore a Spider-Man suit.” That’s
          not a joke. That’s an identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Backend dev isn’t hard — it just doesn’t know I’m coming. I ate
          body-parser and morgan for breakfast.
        </li>
        <li>
          I created a Cake Name Generator. No reason. Just vibes and vanilla
          essence.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Duolingo keeps calling people yasashii sensei” — it’s a whole arc
          now.
        </li>
        <li>
          I started my journaling journey so my great-grandkids can read 07 Jan
          2035 entries and say: “He was HIM.”
        </li>

        <li>
          I believe learning Japanese rewires my brain like a Cyberpunk patch
          update.
        </li>
        <li>
          I fear no enemy. Except maybe the Godskin Duo. Even Jesus wouldn’t
          co-op that boss.
        </li>
      </ul>
